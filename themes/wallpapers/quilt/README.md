# Personal Vaporwave Wallpaper
A pastel vaporwave background inspired by late-90s computing, witchy aesthetics, and the chaos of a well-loved desk. 

This wallpapers blends nostalgia with "girly pop": CRT glow, pixel UI elements, stickers, notebooks, coffee mugs, and gentle purple tones that feel like working late with lofi on.
