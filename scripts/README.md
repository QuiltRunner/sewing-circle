# Scripts

This directory contains helper scripts for installation, cleanup, automation, and general configuration. 
They are intended to support a fast, repeatable setup process across my devices. 

## Structure

### install/

Setup scripts for software, themes, dotfiles, or other components. 

### cleanup/

Scripts that remove old configs, reset themes, or tidy up system cruft. 

### helpers/

Utility scripts used by other scripts or for quick day-to-day tasks. 

**All scripts are meant to be readable and safe to run, but please check paths before executing anything.
If you have ideas for improvements or want to contribute your own helper scripts, feel free!**
