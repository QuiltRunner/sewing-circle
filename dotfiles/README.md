# Dotfile

This directory contains configuration files used across my Linux systems. 
Each subfolder represents a specific application, shell, or component of the 
desktop environment. 

These configs are designed to be:
- Portable
- Readable
- Theme-cohesive
- Easy to copy into new machines or rebuilds

Feel free to explore or use anything here! Suggestions and improvements are always
welcome!
