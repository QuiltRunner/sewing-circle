# Kitty Terminal Configuration

This directory includes configuration files for the Kitty terminal emulator, including: 

- `kitty.conf`
- Color schemes
- Custom keymaps
- Theme files aligned with my pastel / vaporwave / EAS aesthetic

## Usage

Copy or symlink `kitty.conf` to `~/.config/kitty/`.

## Notes

Themes in this folder may reference assets from `themes/`, so remember to keep paths aligned.
