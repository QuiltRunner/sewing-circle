# Dotfiles & Theme Collection

Welcome to my personal dotfiles and theme collection. This repository serves as a
centralized home for the configurations, themes, scripts, and visual assets I use
across my linux systems. It's equal parts practical toolkit and creative sandbox. 

## What You'll Find Here

This repo includes a varierty of configurations for my daily linux environments, including
but not limited to:
- **Dotfiles** for shells, terminals, and desktop environments
- **Theme assets** (KDE Plasma, Kvantum, Kitty, etc)
- **Color palettes & icons** with strong pastel, vaporwave, and F1-inspired asthetics
- **Scripts** to install, automate, or customize part of the desktop
- **Miscellaneous tools** and config snippets that support my workflow

Everything here reflects the way I like to build my systems. 

## Systems I Use

These configs come from several active machines and distros, including:
- **Fedora + KDE Plasma (x86_64)**
- **Arch + KDE Plasma (ThinkPad T460)**
- **MX Linux XFCE (Raspberry Pi 400)**

Not every config applies everywhere, the README will evolve as I organize per-system folders and notes.

## Structure

A full breakdown will grow as the repo fills out, but expect a similar structure to: 
```
dotfiles/
  ├── bash/
  ├── kitty/
  ├── starship/
  ├── fastfetch/
  ├── kvantum/
  └── plasma/

themes/
  ├── color-palettes/
  ├── wallpapers/
  └── assets/

scripts/
  ├── install/
  ├── cleanup/
  └── helpers/
```

Folders will get README notes as needed.

## Contributing & Feedback

I'm always open to suggestions and tips (whether its performance improvements, better ways to
organize configs, or new aesthetic ideas). 

If you're looking through this and spot something that could be improve, please feel free to: 
- Submit an issue
- Share feedback
- Suggest a tweak
- Just say hi

I care about the work I put in here and I'm constantly learning. Constructive feedback is always welcome. 

## 💗 A Note

These dotfiles represent a mix of utility, expermentation, and self-expression. I treat them like digital art (practical,
flexible, and always evolving). Thanks for taking a look!
